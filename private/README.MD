# Private Sources
This directory contains components and samples that are private to the project (intended for development/testing purposes only).

## Structure
Each directory houses component(s) or sample(s) for testing or developing the project. In general programs will be logically stored according to their purpose, and structured as typical programs are within the project.

## Getting Started?
Interested in getting to grips with programs in the project? Have a look at samples, such as the 'hello world!' application under `/private/samples/gtk3/hello`.
