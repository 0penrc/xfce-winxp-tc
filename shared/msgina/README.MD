# libwintc-msgina
This directory contains the source-code for the GINA services (logon/security/auth related functions).

# Purpose
This library provides services related to security. At the moment this includes the APIs for performing user logon (via LightDM), and contains the 'classic' logon dialog.

In future this should be expanded to handle other forms of logon rather than just simple text based local auth, as well as things like the Windows Security dialog.
