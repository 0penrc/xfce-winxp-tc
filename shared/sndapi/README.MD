# libwintc-sndapi
This directory contains the source-code for the system audio abstraction library.

## Purpose
This library exposes a simple, straight-forward API for managing the system audio. It hides away the underlying audio client/server communcation (eg. PulseAudio) to allow programs to get easy access to, and manage, audio devices.
