# libwintc-comgtk
This directory contains the source code for the Common GLib/GTK Utilities library.

## Purpose
This library provides convenience methods for various things across GLib and GTK. This includes things like macros for logging, some string (`gchar*`) manipulation functions, user profile methods etc.

Generally, common small GLib/GTK code snippets that works *with* the code rather than providing large things like full dialogs or features. These utility methods don't really need their own home, so they're collected in this library.
