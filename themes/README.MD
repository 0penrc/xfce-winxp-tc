# Themes
This directory contains the source files used to generate desktop themes (aka *visual styles*).

## Installation
See the `README.MD` under `/packaging/deb/themes` for packaging and installation.

## Under construction
Theme architecture will soon change, so there are no structure docs for the time being.
