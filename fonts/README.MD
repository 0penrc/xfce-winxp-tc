# Fonts
This directory contains the Windows XP system fonts.

## Structure
This is just essentially a bin for fonts, the structure is as follows:

`ttf/` - contains the TrueType font files

`debian-control` - the `control` file used in Debian packaging to provide metadata about the package

## Installation
See the `README.MD` under `/packaging/deb/fonts` for packaging and installation.

## Developing
Should not need any further development in terms of additional fonts - these are all the fonts included with the RTM system.
