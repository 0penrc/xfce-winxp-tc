# Packaging
This directory contains scripts for creating packages for all the various components found in this repository.

## Structure
Each 'type' of component has its own packaging script, in a subdirectory with appropriate notes (cursors, desktop theme, programs etc.). Explore the contents below here and you should find `README`s explaining how to use the scripts and install the components.

## Support?
At the moment you'll notice there is only a `deb` subdirectory. I personally use Debian, so I have got package scripts that generate `.deb` packages so far - if you're also a Debian user, or you use a derivative such as Ubuntu, then you should be good to go.

For users on Linux distributions that use other package managers, I will get around to supporting those one day, it just takes a lot of work and a lot of testing. This `README` will be updated to reflect the status of package manager support when the work is done.
